> A little helper that (possibly) helps you when you're feeling down

I usually get depressed these days, and I realized that remembering what good stuffs I got through kinda helps. 
So I wrote this to just remind me that there're ups and downs, and not to forget what great stuffs I've done just because life hits hard.

Hopefully this can help you too <3

Just clone, `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` for the libs

Run `python pls-send-help.py -a <path-to-image>` or copy then `python pls-send-help.py -ac` or even just move a bunch of them into the folder `acv`

Run `python pls-send-help.py` to launch
